def setup_aim_logger(logger):
    """
    Setup the directory structure for the 'aim' logger.

    This function takes the 'aim' logger object, extracts its unique hash,
    and then renames the current working directory to include this hash.
    It is specifically designed to work with the 'aim' logger in the context of a training setup.

    Args:
        logger (Logger): An instantiated logger object, specifically the 'aim' logger.

    Notes:
        The function assumes that the current working directory ends with a timestamp
        in the format ${now:%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S}. It renames the current directory by appending
        the 'aim' logger's hash to the parent directory's name and then changes the current
        working directory to this new directory.

    # Extract the unique hash associated with the 'aim' logger

    # Get the current working directory
    current_directory = os.getcwd()

    # Determine the parent directory of the current working directory
